Introduction
------------

Welcome to Zotero Maps, a plugin for displaying your Zotero_ collections
on a map in your Firefox web browser.

Zotero Maps uses OpenLayers_ to display geographic markers associated
with your Zotero items on a map in Firefox. The locations of these markers
are generated by taking the value of the *place* field for each item,
and sending it to the GeoNames_ API to get a latitude/longitude 
coordinate. Items associated with the same place name are grouped
together on the map. The background map used in Zotero Maps comes
from the OpenStreetMap_ project.

Zotero Maps is Free and Open Source software, and is distributed under
the `same terms`_ as Zotero itself.

Users' Guide
------------

This Users' Guide for Zotero Maps presumes that you already have Zotero
installed and are familiar with how it works. Additionally, we assume
that you have already added a few items to your Zotero library.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installing Zotero Maps is very simple: Open the `Zotero Maps extension`_ in
your Firefox browser. You will be prompted to confirm the installation and
restart your browser. Please note that you must have a working Internet
connection when using Zotero Maps for it to work properly.

General Use
~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you've restarted Firefox, open Zotero, and browse around your library
until you find an item or a collection containing items that have the *place*
field set. Select this item or collection by clicking on it, then go to the
*Actions* menu (the dropdown menu in the Zotero window with the 'gear' icon),
and click on *View as Map*.

A map will open in your browser window. Since this is presumably the first time
you have used Zotero Maps, a spinner will be displayed while the locations of
your items are being looked up in the GeoNames_ database.  This may take a
while, particularly if your collection is large, so please be patient.

Once all the items have loaded, the spinner will disappear, and you can
browse the items on the map. You can pan by dragging the map with your mouse,
and zoom in and out using the controls on the left hand side of the map. You
can also zoom in by double-clicking on the map.

Click on one of the place markers. A balloon will pop up, showing the name of
the place, and how many items are associated with it. Additionally, the items
associated with that place will be listed underneath it. The title of each item
is hyperlinked, so you can click on it to open that item in Zotero, and view
its details. Clicking the 'X' button in the balloon, or clicking on the marker
will cause the balloon to close.

Congratulations, you're using Zotero Maps! From now on, you can select your
whole library, a single collection, or one or even multiple items, and go to
*Actions -> View as Map* to see them displayed in Zotero Maps.

Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The locations fetched from GeoNames are cached in your Zotero data directory,
so that the next time you open the map, they should display instantly. Also,
after you install Zotero Maps, items will be looked up *as they are added* to
your library, which should also reduce the map loading time in the future.

**Please note** that it is quite likely that *not all* of the items you have
selected will appear on the map. If this is the case, it is likely that the
*place* field is not set on the item in question, or that GeoNames couldn't
figure out where in the world it referred to. Try editing the *place* field on
that item and try loading the map again.

One other note of warning: Due to the limitations of Firefox, only about 100
different items can be displayed in Zotero Maps at once. If you have a large
collection and would like to see this corrected in a future version of Zotero
Maps, please `contact us`_.

Zotero Maps was built by Entropy Free LLC, with the support of the Center for
History and New Media. Schuyler Erle and Tim "Chippy" Waters wrote most of
the code, with assistance from Swapnil Hajare, Kanhaiya Kale, and others.

If you like Zotero Maps and find it useful, please consider supporting any of
the great projects on which Zotero Maps is built, e.g. Zotero_, OpenLayers_,
OpenStreetMap_, or GeoNames_. All four of these terrific projects provide Free
and Open software or services to the community, and deserve your support.

If you would like to see Zotero Maps improved, please feel free to `contact
us`_ with your ideas, comments, suggestions, bug reports, et cetera. If you
would like to provide financial support for the development of specific
features, please `contact us`_. If you would like to contribute code to Zotero
Maps, please read on...

Developers' Guide
-----------------

We specifically invite Free and Open Source developers to contribute
patches to Zotero Maps. What follows is a walk through the code for anyone
interested in improving or extending Zotero Maps.

We presume that you have a working knowledge of JavaScript, Zotero,
and Firefox extension development generally. Before continuing, please
be sure that you have read and are familiar with:

  * Zotero's `Getting Started`_ guide for developers
  * Zotero's `development documentation`_ generally
  * The Zotero Maps `Users' Guide`_

Overview
~~~~~~~~

The Zotero Maps code base is structured like a normal Zotero plugin in most
respects. The ``install.rdf`` and ``chrome.manifest`` files in the top-level
are exactly what you'd expect.
    
The core plugin code all lives in ``chrome/content/zotero-maps/``, while the
static content is in ``chrome/skin/default/zotero-maps/``. One exception is the
OpenLayers library, which does not require Firefox extension privileges at
runtime, and so it lives in the ``skin/`` directory, along with its static
content.

A ``Makefile`` is included with the distribution. We use this to build the
``.xpi`` file. We don't package up the chrome directory as a ``.jar`` file;
please let us know if you can offer a particular reason why we should.
